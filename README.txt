# CS-7641 Supervised Learning (cyin64)

URL for code
https://github.com/cyin64/cs-7641-assignment-2

This project implements the following 4 different randomized optimization algorithms:
- Randomized Hill Climbing (RHC)
- Simulated Annealing (SA)
- Genetic Algorithm (GA)
- MIMIC
 

## Getting Started

### Installing dependencies and running experiments

Use python 3.11
install the following packages:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* sklearn
* yellowbrick
* mlrose


#### Run all algorithms at once:


python cs7641_assignment_2.py


You can also individually run the experiments per function (functions are listed between line 1376 to 1402)
